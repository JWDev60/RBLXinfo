# Roblox Web API

> To access the Roblox Web API, you will need to authenticate your calls using an API token. Here's how you can obtain an API token:

Go to the Roblox Developer Hub website (https://developer.roblox.com/) and sign in with your Roblox account.

Once signed in, navigate to the "My Account" section.

In the "My Account" section, click on the "API Tokens" tab.

Click on the "Create New Token" button.

Enter a name for your token to help you identify it later.

Select the permissions you want to grant to the token. Make sure to choose the appropriate permissions based on the actions you want to perform with the API.

Click on the "Create" button to generate the API token.

Once the token is created, you will see a token string. Copy and securely store this token in a safe place, as it will not be displayed again.

Now that you have your API token, you can use it to authenticate your calls to the Roblox Web API.
